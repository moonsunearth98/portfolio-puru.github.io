        <p class="content">When it comes to Advertisements, the sky is the limit. It is thought that while making an advertisement, especially in India, the critical challenge is often to create an ad that will be diverse. In other words, the ad should present the product like it is perfect for everyone no matter the language, colour, age, budget, interests etc. There are famous examples of that like Bajaj Motorcycle, Coca-Cola, Maggie. They are popular all over India. However, this strategy does not always work. If your competitors are already using it, you have to develop something
             more potent than this. 
            Like in Deodorants' market sector, competitors were already busy stimulating some universal instincts in customers, which was to impress opposite-sex 
            or uniqueness among the group. 
            Then, the Fogg comes with an advertisement. 
            'Aaurr, Kya chal raha hai?'
            'Fogg chal raha hai!'        
            At first glance, it seems so irrelevant that even experts were not convinced by its effectiveness. It was so abnormal that in 35 seconds of the ad, there was significantly less discussion about the USP of the product. Not only that, there was no logic in the ad. Some people hated the ad just because of its absurdness and peculiarity. But to everyone's surprise, the ad was able to increase Fogg's sales by 35% only in three months. After that, it became one of the 
            most selling Deodorants in India.     
            The ad was doing something more robust than focusing on the universality or utility of the product. It targeted the two contradicting basic instincts of the customer. First, Familiarity, which induces comfort; second, Strangeness, which induces attentiveness. 
            On the one hand, the ad uses a very common phrase, 'Kya chal raha hai?' which induces Familiarity, on the other hand, it uses 'Fogg chal raha hai!', which induces Strangeness because people were not expecting the so strange answer of a 
            very common phrase. The ad was so odd that some people hated it, while others find it very peculiar, and for some, it become a joke. 
            No matter how people reacted to the ad, it had completed its goal to make an impression of a product that consumers would remember for an extended period of time.
            The ad was an emblem of the theory that an advertisement's most crucial quality should be stickiness.
